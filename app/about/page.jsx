            santai furniture unites puristic design with the heritage of java.
            each of our furniture pieces is inspired by elements of javanese
            culture and transports a part of local lifestyle to the urban
            living. our portfolio hereby mainly consists of lounge, dining and
            office furniture.
          </p>
          <p>
            we treasure the sustainable origin and great quality of materials
            and emphasize highest precision in our carpentry. our specialization
            lies in solid wood and bamboo furniture, with a wide range of
            customization options, both for the exquisite private home as well
            as hospitality and office projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            for the refinement of our furniture pieces, we apply long grown
            manual skills of experienced craftsmen from central-java â€“ such as
            wood carving and rattan weaving. the preservation and revitalization
            of traditional skills, local lifestyle and at a higher scope,
            javanese culture, lies at the heart of our company.
