    "the KURSI SANTAI line is an homage to the classic SEDAN and JENGKI easy chairs from the 60’s, two of the most recognized design icons from java.",
    "designer SINGGIH S. KARTONO wanted to transport their appeal to the current times and refined the details in alignment to a letter of the javanese ‘hanacaraka’ script, while leaving the iconic silhouettes untouched.",
    "the new KURSI SANTAI relax chairs now come with a smoothly curved armrest and a special rattanweaving pattern that are both delicately crafted by hand.",
    "with its new contemporary appearance and further added furniture types, the KURSI SANTAI line shall now enrich your urban life with the feeling of a slow moment in java and the sensation of heritage.",
